Setting Up the Repo Utility

1. Create a bin folder in your home directory

$ cd ~
$ mkdir ~/bin (this step may not be needed if the bin folder already exists)
$ curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

2. Add the following line to the .bashrc file to ensure that the ~/bin folder is in your PATH variable

$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
